An ecommerce site showcasing a range of plants from cactus plants to indoor, outdoor and pottery. It allows users to view more details about a specific plant, buy as well as make payment. Also there is a blog section with various articles and an FAQ.

## Overview

### Link

Live site URL: [Hatch Gardens](https://loving-blackwell-8bdb2c.netlify.app/)

### Tech Stack Used
- React
- Styled Components
- Greensocks
- Figma
- SCSS

### Approach

I made the design and plant svg design using figma. Then proceeded to work on the front end of the website, using SCSS at first. For the backend i used firebase for the sign in and sign up, the payment gateway utilizes paystack. Used redux to serve as a centralized store for state.

### What I Learned

I initailly started this project with SCSS but switching to styled-components i learned alot of things including creating global styles that can be reused such as typography, how to make connection to firebase and update where necessary. Also how to use redux as a way to by pass the one directional flow of react. My takeaway from redux though is it seems a bit overkill and lots of boilerplating as it requires extensive setup. Overall i learned alot from this project.
